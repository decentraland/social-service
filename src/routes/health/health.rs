/**
 * Readiness probes indicate whether your application is ready to

 * In practical terms, that means the pod is removed from an
 * associated service's "pool" of pods that are handling requests,
 * by marking the pod as "Unready".

 * should return a status code of 400 or higher. Once the startup
